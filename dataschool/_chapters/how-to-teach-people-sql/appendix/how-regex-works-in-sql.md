## What is Regex?

Regex, or Regular Expressions, is a sequence of characters, used to search and locate specific sequences of characters that match a pattern.

In SQL if you were looking for email addresses from the same company Regex lets you define a pattern using comparators and [Metacharacters](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.dbext.doc/ids_dbxt_545.htm), in this case using \~* and % to help define the pattern:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Email Addresses
WHERE Email Address ~* '%@chartio.com'
```

## Using Regex in PostgreSQL

### Metacharacters

Here is a quick cheat sheet for metacharacters to help define the pattern:

| Metacharacter | Description | Example | Examples Matches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ^ | Start the match at the beginning of a string | ^c% | cat, car, chain |
| \| | Alternation (either of two alternatives) | c(a\|o)% | can, corn, cop |
| () | Group items in a single logical item | c(a\|o)% | can, corn, cop |
| _ | Any single character (using LIKE and SIMILAR TO) | c_ | co, fico, pico |
| % | Any string (using LIKE and SIMILAR TO) | c% | chart, articulation, crate |
| . | Any single character (using POSIX) | c. | co, fico, pico |
| .* | Any string (using POSIX) | c.* | chart, articulation, crate |
| + | Repetition of the previous item one or more times | co+ | coo, cool |

### Comparators

There are three ways to use regex comparisons in SQL:

* `LIKE`
* `SIMILAR TO`
* POSIX comparators

LIKE and SIMILAR TO are used for basic comparisons where you are looking for a matching string. LIKE and SIMILAR TO both look and compare string patterns, the only difference is that SIMILAR TO uses the SQL99 definition for regular expressions and LIKE uses PSQL's definition for regular expressions.

**Syntax**: \[String or Column name\] `LIKE`/`SIMILAR TO` \[Regex\]

| Expression | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| 'char' LIKE 'char' | True |
| 'char' LIKE 'c%' | True |
| 'char' LIKE 'ha' | True |
| 'char' LIKE 'c' | False |
| 'char' SIMILAR TO 'char' | True |
| 'char' SIMILAR TO '%(h\|g)%' | True |
| 'char' SIMILAR TO 'h' | False |
| 'char' SIMILAR TO '(a\|b)%' | False |

<br> Unlike LIKE and SIMILAR TO, POSIX is not a keyword that is used in a SQL query. POSIX is a set of comparators for case matches and non equivalency. It is the most powerful way to use Regex in SQL. Regex does not use = and != to compare rather it uses these POSIX comparators:

1. `~` : Case-sensitive, compares two statements, returns true if the first string is contained in the second
2. `~*` : Case-insensitive, compares two statements, returns true if the first string is contained in the second
3. `!~` : Case-sensitive, compares two statements, returns false if the first string is contained in the second
4. `!~*` : Case-insensitive, compares two statements, return false if the first string is contained in the second

**Syntax**: \[String or Column name\] \[POSIX\] \[Regex\]

These comparators can be used in queries to locate or exclude certain data from being returned.

### Examples of Regex in SQL Queries

![POSIX comparator definitions and examples](/assets/images/how-to-teach-people-sql/appendix/how_regex_works/posixTable.png)

If you wanted to search a column of a database for all entries that contain the word 'fire', you could use \~* 'fire' Â to find any row that contains the word:

    SELECT (column name)
    FROM (table name)
    WHERE (column name) ~* 'fire';

![All songs with Fire in the title](/assets/images/how-to-teach-people-sql/appendix/how_regex_works/allFire.png)

To get all entries that start with the word 'Fire':

    SELECT (column name)
    FROM (table name)
    WHERE (column name) ~ * '^fire';

### Summary

* Regular expressions use patterns to match strings.
* Regex provides a way to query databases to find a smaller subset of data.
* The POSIX comparators are:
* `~` : Case-sensitive, compares two statements, returns true if the first is contained in the second
* `~*` : Case-insensitive, compares two statements, returns true if the first is contained in the second
* `!~` : Case-sensitive, compares two statements, returns false if the first is contained in the second
* `!~*` : Case-insensitive, compares two statements, return false if the first is contained in the second
